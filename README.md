☁️ Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

If you want to host this website on Vercel (recommended for Next.js), follow these steps:

1. **Fork this Repository**

`📌 Do not clone directly if you intend to deploy on Vercel. Forking ensures that you have your own copy to connect with Vercel.`

Click the **Fork button** on the top-right of this repository

This will create a copy under your GitHub account

2. **Import into Vercel**

Go to https://vercel.com/import

Choose "Import Git Repository"

Select your forked repo (e.g. your-username/toramaru)

Set up the project as follows:

Framework: Next.js (Vercel will auto-detect)

Environment Variables:

API_KEY → your YouTube API key

CHANNEL_ID → your YouTube channel ID

3. **Deploy**

Click Deploy

Your website will be live in seconds at a Vercel-provided domain (you can later add a custom domain)

✅ You do not need to build or export manually — Vercel will handle everything from install to build to deploy.

CHANNEL_ID=<YOUR_CHANNEL_ID>
```

#### How to get your `CHANNEL_ID`

Go to [https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced](https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced)  
Look for the field labeled **Channel Id**, then copy and paste it into your `.env.local` file.

#### How to get a Google API Key (Step-by-step)

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**  
Open [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and log in with your Google account.

2. **Create or Select a Project**  
- Click the project dropdown menu at the top left  
- Choose an existing project or click **New Project** to create one  
- Enter a project name and click **Create**

3. **Enable the YouTube Data API**  
- From the left sidebar, select **APIs & Services > Library**  
- Search for **YouTube Data API v3**  
- Click on it and then click **Enable**

4. **Create Credentials (API Key)**  
- Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**  
- Click **+ Create Credentials** and select **API Key**  
- Copy the generated API Key and add it to your `.env.local` file as `API_KEY`

> For security, consider restricting your API key usage in the Google Cloud Console.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

---

### 4. Run the Website Locally

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

---

### 5. Check the Result

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

> If port 3000 is already in use, Next.js will run on port 3001 or the next available port.

---

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your `.env.local` file is **not committed** to version control to protect your API keys.
- For production deployment, configure environment variables accordingly on your hosting platform.
- This project supports both server-side rendering and static export.
